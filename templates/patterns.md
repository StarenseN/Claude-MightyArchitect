# Architectural Patterns

Document patterns observed in this project as they emerge.

## How to Use

Patterns are automatically detected and documented by:
- Git commit hook (feat/refactor/perf commits)
- `/architect-review` command
- `/forensic` command (analyzes git history)

You can also manually document patterns here.
