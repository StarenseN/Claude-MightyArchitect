# Bootstrapping MightyArchitect on Existing Project

I'll help you capture the architectural knowledge from your existing codebase.

## Phase 1: Codebase Analysis (I'll do this)

I will:
1. Explore your project structure using the Task tool (medium thoroughness)
2. Identify 5-7 key architectural patterns currently in use
3. Infer major architectural decisions from code structure
4. Create initial `.claude/memory/knowledge/patterns.md`
5. Create initial `.claude/memory/knowledge/decisions.md`

## Phase 2: Knowledge Capture (You'll help)

After analysis, I'll ask you questions about:
- **Rationale**: Why certain decisions were made
- **Timeline**: When patterns emerged or changed
- **Context**: External factors (deadlines, team changes)
- **Pain points**: What you'd change if starting fresh

## Phase 3: Next Steps

Once bootstrapped, we'll:
- Update `.claude/memory/activeContext.md` with current state
- Establish habit of running `/architect-review` after commits
- Use Superpowers skills for new features

## Ready to Start?

Tell me about your project:
- What type of app is it? (web, mobile, API, etc.)
- What's the main tech stack?
- How old is the project? (months/years)
- Any known architectural pain points?

Then I'll begin the automated analysis.
